You are the system administrator for the Y's favourite cars company.  You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may have been compromised by a boating industrial espionage agent.

The person who was assigned this workstation (JaguarXJR9) lost access to his workstation, and in the meantime, the computer is likely to have been used to transfer unauthorized pictures, videos, spreadsheets, and other backdoor files. This person may have also installed spyware or made other changes to compromise the security of the system.

Authorized administrators:

	ubuntu
	JaguarXJR9
	MazdaB787
	Chaparral2J
	AudiR8
	Porsche911

Authorized users:
	SaleenS7
	ToyotaAE86
	C4ChevyCorvetteZR1
	LamborghiniCountach
	AstonMartinVanquish
	ApolloEnraged
	FerrariItalia458
	BugattiVeyron
	MazdaFurai
	MaseratiGranTurismo
	NissanGTRR35
	MaclarenF1
	MitsuokaOrochi
	LamborghiniDiablo
	PaganiZondaF
	DMCDeLorean
	MercedesAMGSLS
	

This workstation is used for web browsing, database processing, e-mail and word processing only.  No video files should be present, although picture files are allowed.
All software packages currently on the system are permitted, but care should be taken that the firewall is enabled.

Due to organizational policies, BugattiVeyron needs to be removed from the group 'italiancraft' [may not be scored].

As part of the security restructure, some users will need to be placed in different groups:
italiancraft: BugattiVeyron, FerrariItalia458, LamborghiniCountach, MaseratiGranTurismo, PaganiZondaF, LamborghiniDiablo
japanesecars: MazdaFurai, ToyotaAE86, NissanGTRR35, MazdaB787, MitsuokaOrochi
germanworkmanship: MercedesAMGSLS, Porsche911GT3, AudiR8, ApolloEnraged

Have fun!
