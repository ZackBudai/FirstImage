You are the system administrator for the Spikey-Turtle-Company.  You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may have been compromised by an Italian Plumber spy.

The person who was assigned this workstation (shyguy) lost access to his workstation, and in the meantime, the computer is likely to have been used to transfer unauthorized pictures, videos, spreadsheets, and other backdoor files. This person may have also installed spyware or made other changes to compromise the security of the system.

Authorized administrators:

	ubuntu
	shyguy
	boo
	bowser

Authorized users:

	iggy
	kamek
	bobomb
	bulletbill
	morton
	wendy
	lemmy
	ludwig
	thwomp

This workstation is used for web browsing, database processing, e-mail and word processing only.  No picture or video files should be present.
There should also not be the presence of any 'hacking' software installed.

Due to organizational policies, bowser will need to use a restricted shell [unscored on image]

boo and bobomb need to form a new group called benemies as part of this security restructure.
No other groups (other than sudo and benemies), containing authorized users, should be allowed on the system.
