Note: Users on AWS may need to run the following code if they don't have permissions to write files etc:
sudo -i


You are the system administrator for the Native Australian Company.  You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may have been compromised by an foreign intelligence agent.

The person who was assigned this workstation (quokka) lost access to his workstation, and in the meantime, the computer is likely to have been used to transfer unauthorized pictures, videos, spreadsheets, and other backdoor files. This person may have also installed spyware or made other changes to compromise the security of the system.

Authorized administrators:

	ubuntu
	quokka
	kangeroo
	wombat
	echidna

Authorized users:
	wallaby
	koala
	opossum
	tasmaniandevil
	platypus
	eudyptula_minor 
	kookaburra
	emu
	cane_toad

This workstation is used for web browsing, database processing, e-mail and word processing only.  No video files should be present, although picture files are allowed.
There should also not be the presence of any 'hacking' software installed.

Due to organizational policies, cane_toad will need to use a restricted shell [unscored on image]

As part of the security restructure, some users will need to be placed in different groups:
avians: kookaburra, eudyptula_minor, emu
marsupials: quokka, kangeroo, wombat, echidna, wallaby, koala, opossum, tasmaniandevil


Critical services: falkon


Note for CT Trainees: The software installer package is famously buggy on AWS. If you start with things scored, just try to undo them and redo them.
